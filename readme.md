## Introduction

In this assignment, I used the model-view-controller design pattern together with the JavaFX UI library to design a complete, functioning GUI implementation of the single-player logic puzzle akari.

If you've never heard of akari before, I highly suggest starting by checking out [the akari Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Up_(puzzle)). After you do that, [try solving a few akari puzzles](https://www.puzzle-light-up.com/).
